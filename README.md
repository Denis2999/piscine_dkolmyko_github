# Piscine by Denis Kolmyko - 42 School

Welcome to my 42 School Piscine repository! This collection contains solutions to various exercises completed during the 42 School's coding bootcamp.

## Project Structure

- **`c_00` to `c_12`:** Solutions to the C programming exercises, organized by topics such as functions, pointers, memory management, and more.
- **`rush_00` to `rush_02`:** Weekend coding challenges (Rush projects).
  
Each folder contains subdirectories with individual exercise solutions, including source files, headers, and test cases.

## Usage

To run any exercise:
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/Denis2999/piscine_dkolmyko_github`
2. Navigate to the desired folder.
3. Compile the code using `gcc` or the preferred compiler:
   gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -o program_name source_file.c
4. Execute the compiled binary:
   ./program_name

## Requirements

- Ensure you have GCC or any standard C compiler installed on your system.
